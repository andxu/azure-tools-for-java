/**
 * Each time when you start a transaction, we will generate a operationId(the operationId will store in thread local),
 * then you can send info,warn,error with this operationId, you need to end this transaction.
 * If you start a new transaction without close the previous one, we just generate a new operationId.
 * If you send info, error, warn or end transaction without start a transaction, we will ignore this operation.
 * Take care, each time when you start a transaction you need to end it. Or you cannot correctly trace the operation.
 *
 * If you just want to record an event or error, you do not want to trace the transaction. Please directly use
 * EventUtil.logevent or EventUtil.logerror.
 *
 * For transaction, the snappy code just like this:
 *   try {
 *       startTransaction();
 *       doSomething();
 *       sendInfo();
 *   } catch (Exception e) {
 *       sendError();
 *   } finally {
 *       endTransaction();
 *   }
 *
 *   For independent event, the snappy code just like this:
 *   dosomething1();
 *   logEvent();
 *   dosomething2();
 *   logEvent();
 *
 *   Sequence Diagram:
 *
 *                         operationId
 *   start a transaction        |
 *   send info                  |
 *   send info                  |
 *   send error                 |
 *   end a transaction          v
